For my final project, I utilized the Healthcare Marketplace data from 2017 to predict plan prices based on the number of benefits and network providers. I first cleaned the three data sets and analyzed what information I needed from each. Then I combined the information using plan IDs and issuer IDs as the common fields. I used part of the combined clean data to train my model to come up with an equation that can be used to predict a healhcare plan price based on number of benefits and network providers.
