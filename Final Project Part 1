The following possible problem statements are for Option 2: Health Insurance Marketplace:
  1. How do plan rates and benefits vary across states and how do plan benefits relate to plan rates?
  The data sets that will be needed to answer this question are Rate.csv and BenefitCostSharing.csv. In Rate file we can obtain the rates for individuals, couple, subscribers with dependents, etc across states. We can also use this information to analyze which plan is cheaper per person insured. We can join Rate with BenefitCostSharing on IssueId and IssueId2. By joining these, we can obtain for the specific cost average in a sate what the benefits are from BenefitCostSharing. Some of the challenges I anticipate are how to quantify the benefits. For example, would we check the number of benefits or how much copay each one requires? This will require more investigation on the data available and maybe also some reading on health insurance in general to understand what benefits are defined as.
  2. How do plans vary across insurance network providers?
  The data sets that will be needed to answer this question are Rate.csv, BenefitCostSharing.csv and Network.csv. This problem statement can include the questions answered in the first statement but adding an extra layer: networks. Just by analyzing Network file, we can obtain metrics such as number of providers available per state. We can join Network to Rate by joining on IssuerId and IssuerID2 too. We can utilize all three data sets to compare costs and benefits across network providers, look at difference between providers across states, differences in plans across providers, etc. The main challenge I see here is the same one as above: quantifying the benefits.
